# FarmField Simulation Application


Java Coursework - Farm Simulation


Rishi Verma & Edward Rowlands Java coursework 2015


Basic Farm simulation application written in Java.



Notes: 
1) somethings need refactoring e.g. common code from weed, beanplant and farmer should be pushed up into the Actor class.


2) We need to find out how to load up the JFrame? This should be done (I'm guessing here) from the FarmField.java file which contains the Main() application entry point e.g. the first line of code to be executed.


3) How to draw out the grid on the JFrame and populate it?


4) How many steps/iterations should take place during the lifetime of the application?


5) Should the steps be consecutive? or is some prompt needed to take the next move?


6) When should the application end?
